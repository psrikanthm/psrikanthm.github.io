We would like to write code to plot normal distrbution in python.

First lets import few libraries which are needed to generate normal distribution and plot them.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
import math
```

Sample from normal pdf using `stats` module and plot using matplotlib.
```python
mu = 0
variance = 1
sigma = math.sqrt(variance)
x = np.linspace(mu - 3*sigma, mu + 3*sigma, 100)
plt.plot(x, stats.norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma))
plt.show()
```
