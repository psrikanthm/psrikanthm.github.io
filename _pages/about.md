I always cherished the writing process of my [Master's thesis](https://www.escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xh23p). 

Here me writing again, after so much of life events since then that I don't even understand the equations I derived back then. 

Hear me writing again, to discomfort myself in the hopes of discovering and learning.
