Text messages we send everyday.  
Emails in your inbox.  
The website of a company.  
User manuals from 10 different Washers manufacturers in the folder *user_manuals_washer*.  
These are some of the examples of "unstructured" data where there is no pre-defined model for the data.
I enjoy working with this kind of data, and wanted to share any interesting findings through this blog.
Would be delighted to hear your approaches in dealing with unstructured data, start conversation
